      <description>Hello there! :)
So, for those of you who want to write distributed systems easily in Python or are just curious about the subject, I was studying about Java RMI for my Distributed Systems class and I always get thrilledto know that I need to write Java code. Nothing against good ol’ Java, it’s just not my vibe these days but I’d happily do it if convinced. Since I was just studying and trying to learn a concept, I searched for a Python alternative.</description>

      <description>This is the first of a series of posts that I will write to share some knowledge I gained on Python Web Frameworks plus a nice, public way to push me into learning more and more about them.
I’ve decided to do the same project on all of them, starting with Django Rest Framework. This is will be a standalone analysis and then I will move forward to comparisons. My intention is to find a good framework to plug into a database and see how well it handles GET requests.</description>

      <title>Why you should choose your Python module names more carefully</title>

      <description>We code everyday. We produce code fast, following the rhythm of the rock and roll guitar playing in the background and every time we focus on writing code fast, we miss some important things that makes us lose time in the future.
The next time you create a new file in your Python project, think about its name very carefully. Every Python file is a module. We import modules all the time.</description>
